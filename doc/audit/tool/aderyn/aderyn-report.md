# High Issues

## H-1: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

## L-2: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.
