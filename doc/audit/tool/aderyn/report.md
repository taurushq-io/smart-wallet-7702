# High Issues

## H-1: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

## L-2: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.

## L-3: Unused State Variable

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inline assembly references it. Consider removing this unused variable.

</details>



## L-4: Uninitialized Local Variable

Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.
